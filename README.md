# Project Overview

This project implements tv script generation model using RNN in pytorch as part of my learning journey in the Udacity deep-learning nanodegree program. The training data is taken from American television series [Seinfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld) which can be found in the data directory.
